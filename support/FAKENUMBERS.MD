The landlines utilise random digits attached to one or two prefixes â€“ 5550 or 7010. They can be used for each state or territory.

For example, in NSW they would be (02) 5550 xxxx and (02) 7010 xxxx. You can attach whatever numbers you like in place of each 'x'. But if you wanted a Queensland you would change these to (07) 5550 xxxx and (07) 7010 xxxx.

Please note that these numbers are for testing purposes only and should not be used for any real communication.
